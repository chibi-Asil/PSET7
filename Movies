# Write SQL queries to answer questions about a database of movies.

-- Table: 
    -- CREATE TABLE movies (id, title, year, PRIMARY KEY(id));
    -- CREATE TABLE stars (movie_id, person_id, FOREIGN KEY(movie_id), FOREIGN KEY(person_id);
    -- CREATE TABLE directors (movie_id, person_id, FOREIGN KEY(movie_id), FOREIGN KEY(person_id));
    -- CREATE TABLE ratings (movie_id, person_id, FOREIGN KEY(movie_id), FOREIGN KEY(person_id));
    -- CREATE TABLE people (movie_id, name, birth, PRIMARY KEY(id));

-- ASSIGNMENT: In 1.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles of all movies released in 2008.
    -- Your query should output a table with a single column for the title of each movie.
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE year = 2008;

-- In 2.sql, write a SQL query to determine the birth year of Emma Stone.
-- Your query should output a table with a single column and a single row (not including the header) containing Emma Stoneâ€™s birth year.
-- You may assume that there is only one person in the database with the name Emma Stone.
SELECT birth FROM people WHERE name = 'Emma Stone';

-- In 3.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles of all movies with a release date on or after 2018, in alphabetical order.
-- Your query should output a table with a single column for the title of each movie.
-- Movies released in 2018 should be included, as should movies with release dates in the future.
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE year >= 2018;
